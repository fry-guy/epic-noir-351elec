This is an modified version of the EmulationStation theme titled "Epic Noir," created by @nil06 (c64-dev) and available online at https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir#readme. It contains a number of small tweaks designed to improve readbaility on handheld devices, specificially the RG351P or RG351M using the Custom Firmwares 351Elec or ArkOS.

- Slightly increased default font sizes to improve small screen readability

- A new splash screen image, controller image, and description text for the Pokémon mini. Preview at https://imgur.com/gallery/IR8eJig.

- A new default splash image and description text for Pico-8 and TIC-80. (Both feature this image: https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp5987705.jpg)

- A modified splash screen image, new controller image and description text for the Watara Supervision. (351 Elec only)

- A new splash screen image and description text for the RetroArch page (ArkOS only). Art by instagram.com/rachidlotf

- A modified splash screen image, a new controller image and description text for the TI-99. (ArkOS only)

- A splash screen image, controller image and description text for SNES MSU-1. (Images same as default SNES theme.)

- Removed the lightening bolt symbol from the universal background image so it doesn’t conflict with the battery icon in 351Elec.

- Minor tweaks to some other default systems art to reduce repetition (e.g. no longer uses the same image for Neo Geo Pocket and Neo Geo Pocket Color)
